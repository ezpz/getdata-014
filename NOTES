In either of the {test|train} directories these are the data:

    X_test.txt:
        Each row is a 561 element vector representing the features listed
        in features.txt. 
        According to the assignment, we only need information related to the 
        mean and std. dev. (columns that contain 'mean()' or 'std()' 
        as described in features_info.txt)
        A quick grep shows 33 of each type in features.txt.

    y_test.txt:
        Each row represents the type of activity for each entry in X_test.txt.
        These numeric values are explained (i.e. mapped to text) in 
        activity_labels.txt

    subject_test.txt:
        The ID of the test subject for each entry in X_test.txt.

    Inertial Signals/*:
        The original unprocessed data. I believe this is informational only
        and can be excluded from the processing. R on a 32-bit system will 
        not be capable of loading all this data @ nine 6M and nine 15M files 
        for the test and training data, respectively.
